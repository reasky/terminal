# TERMINAL ([reasky.ru](reasky.ru))

A personal website styled as an old-school terminal emulator.  
The user interacts with the interface via commands — just like in a real CLI.

## Core commands

— `ls`  
Lists the contents of the current directory. Folders are marked with `/`.

— `cd <dir>`  
Changes the directory. Supports `cd ..` to go up and `cd` with no arguments to return to `~`.

— `whoami`  
Returns the string `visitor`.

— `cat <filename>`  
Displays the contents of a file line by line, if the file exists.

— `memo <filename>`  
Triggers a "memory" — a visual scene built with React Three Fiber.  
Supports `house.memory`. Can be launched in dev mode via `--dev`.

— `clear`  
Clears the terminal output.
